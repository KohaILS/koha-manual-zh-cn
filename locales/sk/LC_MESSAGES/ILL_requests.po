msgid "The ILL (Interlibrary loans) requests module adds the ability to request and manage loans or copies of material from external sources. Patrons can submit a request via the OPAC from the :ref:`your interlibrary loan requests <your-interlibrary-loan-requests-label>` tab of their account.  Library staff can then review and process those requests.  Alternatively staff can place requests themselves from the staff client."
