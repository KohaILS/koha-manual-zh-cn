Patrons
===============================================================================

Before importing or adding patrons be sure to set up your 
:ref:`patron categories <patron-categories-label>`.

.. _add-a-new-patron-label:

Add a new patron
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patrons are added by going to the 'Patrons' module.

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Once there you can add a new patron.

-  Click 'New patron'

   |image407|

-  The fields that appear on the patron add form can be controlled by
   editing the :ref:`BorrowerUnwantedField` system preference.

-  Required fields are defined in the :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField` system
   preference

-  First, enter the identifying information regarding your patron

   |image408|

   -  'Salutation' is populated by the :ref:`BorrowersTitles` system preference

   -  **Note**

          If you'd like to prevent full names from printing on
          :ref:`slips <notices-and-slips-label>` and you're not using the Initials or
          Other name fields for anything else, you can use them for
          shortened versions of the name to then be printed on the slip.

          For example:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole C.
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: NCE

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>> instead of the full name (NCE).

          Or you could do something like this:

          ::

              Firstname: Nicole
              Surname: Engard
              Initials: E

          Then on the slip you can have it print the
          <<borrowers.initials>>, <<borrowers.firstname>> instead of the
          full name (E, Nicole).

-  If this patron is a child, you will be asked to attach the child
   patron to an adult patron (guarantor)

   **Note**
   Guarantors can only be attached to patrons whose :ref:`category <patron-categories-label>` 
   is of the 'Child', 'Professional' or 'Organization' type.

   |image410|

   -  If the guarantor is a patron of the library, click 'Search to add' to 
      search your system for an existing patron

      |image1463|

   -  Click 'Select' to choose the patron

      |image1464|

   -  The relationships are set using the :ref:`borrowerRelationship` system 
      preference

      |image1465|

           **Note**

           It is possible to add more than one guarantor to a patron account 
           (both parents for example).

   -  If the guarantor is not a patron, you can still add their information in 
      the 'Non-patron guarantor' section.

-  Next enter the main address and contact information

   |image1466|

       **Note**

       The street type is populated by the ROADTYPE 
       :ref:`authorized values <existing-values-label>`

   |image409|

   -  For contact information, note that the primary phone number and primary 
      email address are the ones that appear on notices and slips printed
      during circulation (receipts, transfer slips and hold slips). The
      primary email is also the one that overdue notices and other
      messages go to.

-  You can also record an alternate address for each patron. This could be used 
   in an academic setting to store the patron's home address for example.

   |image411|

-  Each patron can have an alternate contact. An alternate contact could be a 
   parent or guardian, for example.

   |image412|

-  The library management section includes values that are used within
   the library

   |image413|

   -  The card number field is automatically calculated if you have the
      :ref:`autoMemberNum` system preference set that way

      -  **Note**

             For a newly installed system this preference will start at
             1 and increment by 1 each time after. To have it start with
             the starting number of your barcodes, enter the first
             barcode by hand in the patron record and save the patron.
             After that the field will increment that number by 1.

   -  If you accidentally chose the wrong patron category at the
      beginning you can fix that here

   -  Sort 1 and 2 are used for statistical purposes within your library

      -  You can create drop-down menus for these fields by adding values 
         in the Bsort1 and Bsort2 :ref:`authorized values categories <existing-values-label>`

   -  'Allow auto-renewal of items' is used to control whether this patron’s checkouts will be renewed according to the circulation rules. If set to ‘Yes’, items for which automatic renewal is enabled in the circulation rules will be automatically renewed. This requires the 
      :ref:`automatic_renewal cronjob <cron-automatic-renewal-label>` to run 
      daily. If set to ‘No’, items for which automatic renewal is enabled in the circulation rules will not be automatically renewed.

   -  'Check for previous checkouts' is used to set the patron's personal 
      preference regarding checking their circulation history to see if they 
      have borrowed This item in the past. This overrides the setting of the 
      :ref:`patron category <adding-a-patron-category-label>` and of the 
      :ref:`CheckPrevCheckout` system preference.

-  Next, the library set-up section includes additional library settings

   |image414|

   -  The registration date will automatically be filled in with today's
      date

   -  The expiry date will automatically be calculated based on your 
      :ref:`patron category settings <patron-categories-label>`

   -  The OPAC note is a note for the patron, it will appear in the patron's 
      online account on the OPAC

      |image1504|

      **Note**

      See also :ref:`OPAC messages <opac-messages-label>`

   -  The Circulation note is meant solely for your library staff and
      will appear when the circulation staff goes to check an item out
      to the patron

      |image415|

-  The 'OPAC/Staff interface login' section asks for the username and 
   password to be used by the patron (or staff member) to log into their 
   account in the OPAC and for staff to log in to the staff interface.

   -  Staff will only be able to use this login information to log in to
      the staff interface if they have at least the 
      :ref:`catalogue permission <patron-permissions-label>`.

-  If you have enabled the housebound module (with the :ref:`HouseboundModule` 
   system preference), you will be able to choose a 
   :ref:`housebound role <housebound-patrons-label>` for this patron.

   |image1509|

-  If you have set :ref:`additional patron attributes <patron-attribute-types-label>` 
   in the administration module, these will appear next

   |image416|

-  Finally, if you have the :ref:`EnhancedMessagingPreferences` system 
   preference set to 'allow,' you can choose the messaging preferences for 
   this patron.

   |image417|

   See the definition of each notice in the 
   :ref:`advance notices and hold notices <advance-notices-and-hold-notices-label>`
   section

   -  **Important**

          These preferences will override any you set via the :ref:`patron
          categories <adding-a-patron-category-label>`

   -  **Important**

          These preference can be altered by the patron via the OPAC if the 
          :ref:`EnhancedMessagingPreferencesOPAC` system preference is set to 
          'show'

-  Once finished, click 'Save'

If the system suspects this patron is a duplicate of another it will
warn you.

|image418|

    **Note**

    See the :ref:`PatronDuplicateMatchingAddFIelds` system preference to see 
    or change which fields are used to detect duplicate patrons. The default is 
    the surname, the firstname and the date of birth.

If you have set a minimum or upper age limit on the patron category and
are requiring that the birth date be filled in, Koha will warn you if
the patron you're adding is too old or young for the patron category you
have selected:

|patronagelimit|

If the patron's :ref:`category <patron-categories-label>` has an enrollment 
fee, the fee will be charged to the patron's account when the account is 
created. You can then manage the charge in the patron's :ref:`accounting tab <fines-label>`.

.. _quick-add-patron-label:

Quick add a patron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your circulation desk is very busy and you want to register patron quickly,
you can use the 'quick add' feature. It's a shortened version of the add
patron form with only a couple of necessary fields to fill out.

This feature uses two system preferences: :ref:`BorrowerMandatoryField`
and :ref:`PatronQuickAddFields`. These are the two system preferences that
control which fields are in the quick add form.

To quick add a patron, go to the Patrons module

-  *Get there:* Patrons

Click on the 'Quick add new patron' button.

You will be asked to choose a patron category.

Then, you will be presented with a shortened form.

|image1346|

Once the form is filled out, click on 'Save'.

If you need to access the full form, you can click on 'Show full form'
above the 'Save' button.

.. _add-a-staff-patron-label:

Add a staff patron
----------------------------------------

All staff members must be entered into Koha as patrons of the 'Staff'
type. Follow the steps in :ref:`Add a Patron <add-a-new-patron-label>` to add a
staff member. To give the staff member permissions to access the staff
client, follow the steps in :ref:`patron permissions <patron-permissions-label>`

    **Important**

    Remember to assign your staff secure usernames and passwords since
    these will be used to log into the staff client.

.. _add-a-statistical-patron-label:

Add a statistical patron
----------------------------------------------

One way to track use of in house items is to "check out" the materials
to a statistical patron. The "check out" process doesn’t check the book
out, but instead tracks an in house use of the item. To use this method
for tracking in house use you first will need a :ref:`patron
category <patron-categories-label>` set up for your statistical patron.

|image420|

Next, you will need to create a new patron of the statistical type.

|image421|

Next, follow the steps put forth in the ':ref:`Add a new
patron <add-a-new-patron-label>`' section of this manual. Since this patron is
not a real person, simply fill in the required fields, the correct
library and nothing else.

To learn about other methods of tracking in house use visit the
:ref:`tracking inhouse use <tracking-in-house-use-label>` section of this manual.

.. _duplicate-a-patron-label:

Duplicate a patron
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want
to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to
duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to)
change.

-  Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to
   duplicate information from)

-  Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record

   |image422|

-  All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number,
   username and password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing
   pieces and click 'Save'

   |image423|

   -  **Note**

          Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will
          clear that field of all information (making it easier for you
          to type in something different)

-  You will be brought to your new patron

   |image424|

.. _add-patron-images-label:

Add patron images
----------------------------------------

If you would like you can add patron images to help identify patrons. To
enable this feature you must first set the
:ref:`patronimages` preference to 'Allow'.

If the preference is set to 'Allow' you will see a placeholder image
under the patron's name and box to upload a patron image below the basic
contact information.

|image425|

In the 'Upload patron image' box click 'Browse' to find the image on
your computer and 'Upload' to load the image on to the patron record.

|image426|

    **Important**

    There is a limit of 100K on the size of the picture uploaded and it
    is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images
    will work as well.

.. _editing-patrons-label:

Editing patrons
----------------------------------

Patrons in Koha can be edited using one of many edit buttons.

-  To edit the entire patron record simply click the 'Edit' button at
   the top of the patron record.

   |image427|

-  Patron passwords are not recoverable. The stars show on the patron
   detail next to the password label are always there even if a password
   isn't set. If a patron forgets their password the only option is to
   reset their password. To change the patron's password, click the
   'Change password' button.

   |image428|

   -  Koha cannot display existing passwords as they are encrypted in the
      database. Leave the field blank to leave password unchanged.

   -  This form can automatically generate a random password if you
      click the link labeled "Click to fill with a randomly generated
      suggestion. Passwords will be displayed as text."

-  To edit a specific section of the patron record (for example the
   'Library use' section) click the 'Edit' button beside the section.

   |image429|

-  A patron image can be added by browsing for the image on your machine
   from the 'Manage patron image' section.

   |image430|

   -  This form will not appear if you have the
      :ref:`patronimages` system preference to not allow
      patron images.

   -  To add patron images in bulk, use the :ref:`Upload patron
      images <upload-patron-images-label>` tool.

-  Patrons can also be blocked from checking items out by setting Patron
   flags

   |image431|

   -  If you would like your circulation staff to confirm a patron's
      address before checking items out to the patron, you can see the
      'Gone no address' flag

      |image432|

   -  If the patron reports that they have lost their card you can set
      the 'Lost card' flag to prevent someone else from using that card
      to check items out

      |image433|

   -  If you would like to bar a patron from the library you can add a
      manual restriction

      |image434|

      -  **Note**

             This flag can automatically be set with the :ref:`Overdue/notice
             status triggers <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`

   -  If you enter in a date and/or note related to the restriction you
      will see that in the restricted message as well

      |image435|

-  Children patrons do not become adults automatically in Koha unless
   you have the :ref:`Update patron categories <cron-update-patron-categories-label>` cron job running. To
   upgrade a child patron to and adult patron category manually go to
   the 'More' menu and choose 'Update child to adult patron'

   |image436|

   -  You will then be presented with a pop up window asking which one
      of your adult patron categories this Child should be updated to

      |image437|

.. _renew-patron-account-label:

Renew patron account
----------------------------------

When renewing a patron account you can either edit the the expiry date
manually in the patron record or use the 'Renew patron' option from the
More menu in the toolbar at the top.

|image1393|

Using the latter the new expiry date will be calculated using the
enrollment period configured for the patron category of the user.
The system preference :ref:`BorrowerRenewalPeriodBase` determines if
the new expiry date will be calculated from the current date or from the
old expiry date.

One advantage of using the 'Renew patron' option is that it will be logged
as a membership renewal in the action_logs table and be visible as such
when using the :ref:`Log viewer <log-viewer-label>` or the
:ref:`Modificaton log <modification-log-label>` from the patron account.

The renewal date of the patron account will be visible on the details tab.

|image1392|

If the patron is in a :ref:`patron category <patron-categories-label>` with a 
membership fee, the charge will also be added upon renewal. You can then manage 
the charge in the patron's :ref:`accounting tab <fines-label>`.

.. _delete-patron-account-label:

Deleting a patron account
----------------------------------

From the 'More' drop-down, the patron account can be deleted. 

|image1469|

There will be an alert if the patron has checkouts, holds, fines or credits. 

-  If a patron has current checkouts, the deletion will not be possible. 

   |image1470|

-  If a patron has outstanding fines, the deletion will not be possible.

   |image1468|

-  If a patron has unused credits, the option to delete the patron is possible 
   but there will be a warning.

   |image1471|

-  If a patron has existing holds on their account, the option to delete the 
   patron is possible. The hold will be cancelled and moved to the old reserves 
   table. 

   |image1462|

.. _managing-patron-self-edits-label:

Managing patron self edits
--------------------------------------------------

If you are allowing patrons to edit their accounts via the OPAC with the
:ref:`OPACPatronDetails` preference then you will need
to approve all changes via the staff client before they're applied. If
there are patron edits awaiting action they will appear on the staff
client dashboard below the modules list (along with other items awaiting
action).

|image438|

    **Note**

    Superlibrarians will see modifications for any branch, other staff
    will only see modifications for patrons who belong to their logged
    in branch.

When you click the 'Patrons requesting modifications' link you will be
brought to a list of patrons with requested changes.

|image439|

From here you can 'Approve' and apply the changes to the patron record,
'Delete' and remove the changes or 'Ignore' and keep the changes pending
to review later.

If you would like to see the entire patron record you can click the
'Patron details' links to the right of the buttons. This will open in a
new tab.

Merging patron records
-----------------------------------

If you accidentally end up with one patron with two cards it is possible
to merge their records together so that you don't lose their loan history
or holds.

-  In the patron list, check the boxes next to the records you want to
   merge and click on the 'Merge selected patrons' button.

|image1326|

    **Note**

    It is possible to merge more than two records at a time.

-  Select the patron record you want to keep

   |image1327|


-  If necessary, click the 'Compare patrons' button to see the differences 
   between the different accounts.

   |mergepatrons-compare|

-  Click the 'Merge patrons' button.

The checkouts and statistics will be transferred to the right record and
the other one will be deleted.

|image1328|

.. _patron-permissions-label:

Patron permissions
-------------------------------------------

Patron permissions are used to allow staff members access to the staff
client.

    **Important**

    In order for a staff member to log into the staff interface they
    must have (at the very least) 'catalogue' permissions which allow
    them to view the staff interface.

.. _setting-patron-permissions-label:

Setting patron permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  On the patron record click 'More' and choose 'Set permissions' to alter
   patron permissions

   |image440|

-  You will be presented with a list of preferences, some of which can
   be expanded by clicking the 'Show details' link on the right
   title.

   |image441|

-  In all cases, if the parent permission is checked, the user has all the
   child permissions. If you want to set permissions on a more granular level,
   expand the section and only check the permissions you want that user to
   have.

   |image1461|

Circulation summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below the patron's information on the details screen is a tabbed display
of the items they have checked out, overdue, and on hold.

Checkouts
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The first tab shows the items the patron currently has checked out.

|image445|

     **Note**

     -  You can customize the columns of this table in the 
        :ref:`'Table settings'<column-settings-label>` section of the 
        Administration module (table id: issues-table).

Relatives' checkouts
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If they have family at the library, staff can see what the other family
members have checked out.

|image446|

Charges
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Charges tab will only show in the patron accounts that have unpaid amounts 
or unused credits.

The tab will show the total amount, without any details. To see the details, 
go to the :ref:`accounting tab <fines-label>`.

|image1360|

Holds
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If the patron has holds, the number of holds will appear on this tab's
title and the details will appear in the tab.

|image490|

     **Note**

     The barcode and call number will only appear on item-level holds or
     holds that have been confirmed. Record-level holds that are not
     waiting to be picked up will not have barocdes or call numbers.

From here you can manage the patron's holds: change the pickup library,
cancel or suspend holds.

     **Note**

     You will only be able to suspend holds if the :ref:`SuspendHoldsIntranet`
     system preference is set to "Allow".

     **Note**

     If, when suspending a hold, you want to be able to set a date at which to
     automatically resume the hold, set the :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds`
     system preference to "Allow" and make sure the :ref:`unsuspend_holds cron
     job <cron-unsuspend-holds-label>` is activated.

.. _article-requests-label:

Article requests
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If the :ref:`ArticleRequests` system preference is enabled, and the circulation
rules allow it, the patrons will be able to request articles, either through the
OPAC or in the staff interface.

The details of the patron's request, and its status, are visible in this
tab.

|image1361|

Restrictions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Restrictions tab will show for all patrons. If the patron has no
restrictions you will see that on the tab.

|image447|

If the patron has restrictions on their account the tab will show the
number and the description.

There are four kinds of restrictions:
  - Manual
  - Overdues
  - Suspension
  - Discharge

Using the 'Add manual restriction' button you can add a restriction to
the patron record from here. This can be used for any type of restriction
you need to put manually on a patron record.

|image449|

|image448|

The overdues restrictions are automatically set when overdue notices are sent
if you specified you wanted the patron restricted in the
:ref:`Overdue notice/status triggers tool <overdue-notice/status-triggers-label>`.

This restriction will not be removed automatically when the overdue items are
returned unless the :ref:`AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions` system preference
is set to 'Do'.

In the :ref:`circulation rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`, you can choose
to fine users by suspending them instead of (or in addition to) fining them money.
In that case, returning an overdue document will trigger a suspension restriction.

Patrons may also be restricted if you have issued a :ref:`discharge <patron-discharges-label>` for them. Once the discharge is validated, the patron is automatically restricted.

Restrictions on a patron record will block checkouts. In fact,
a message will appear in red when going to the checkout page.

|image1363|

Restrictions may also prevent renewing items if the :ref:`RestrictionBlockRenewing`
system preference is set to 'block'.

On the OPAC, patrons will get a message saying their account is frozen. They will
not be able to place holds from the OPAC.

If you have patrons that have more than one restriction, you can choose to
cumulate their restriction periods or not through the :ref:`CumulativeRestrictionPeriods`

Patrons can choose to receive their notices as a digest by checking the 
'Digest only' box along with the delivery method. A digest is a combination of 
all the messages of that type (so all items due in 3 days in one email) in to 
one email instead of multiple emails for each alert.

The delivery methods currently supported are: 

-  Email
-  SMS (text messages)
-  Automated phone call system
-  Print

To generate the advance notices (advance notice and item due), you need to run the 
:ref:`advance\_notices.pl cronjob <cron-advanced-notice-label>`. Then, the 
:ref:`process\_message\_queue.pl cronjob <cron-message-queue-label>` will send 
the notices or the :ref:`gather\_print\_notices.pl cronjob <cron-print-hold-notices-label>` 
will gather them in a nice file you can print out and send out via regular mail.
