OpacAdditionalStylesheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   If you upload a custom file, opac-mystyles.css to this directory, you
   can specify it by entering opac-mystyles.css in your
   opaccolorstylesheet system preference. This adds your custom
   stylesheet as a linked stylesheet alongside the OPAC's default CSS
   files. This method is preferable because linked stylesheets are
   cached by the user's browser, meaning upon repeat visits to your site
   the user's browser will not have to re-download the stylesheet,
   instead using the copy in the browser's cache.

-  If you would rather, you can upload your CSS to another server and
   enter the full URL pointing to it's location remember to begin the
   URL with http://

-  Don't include

Description:

-  This preference controls whether the :ref:`OPACFineNoRenewals` function uses
   the account balance (which combines outstanding credits and debits) or
   account amount outstanding (which excludes any credits) to make the calculation.

    **Note**

    Generally you would set this system preference to align with
    the :ref:`AccountAutoReconcile` system preference.  If you have
    AccountAutoReconcile set to ‘Do’ you should leave this system preference as
    ‘Include’.  If you have AccountAutoReconcile set to ‘Do not’ it would make
    sense to have this set as ‘Don’t include’.

       preferences.

.. _patronselfmodificationborrowerunwantedfield-label:

Description:

-  Setting this preference to 'Allow' will provide a link on the OPAC to

   can control how this preference will function.

   |image103|

    **Important**

    Patrons registering via the OPAC will not need to be approved by a
    librarian. For this reason it is recommended that you set up a
    provisional :ref:`patron category <patron-categories-label>` with no :ref:`circulation
    rights <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`. That way patrons will have to come in to
    the library to verify their identity before given circulation rights
    at the library. Once the patron confirms their identity the library
    staff can change the category to one with permissions to check items
    out and place holds.

    the database
    structure <http://schema.koha-community.org/master/tables/borrowers.html>`__
    associated with the borrowers table.

    **Note**

    If you're going to require that patrons verify their accounts via
    email with the
    :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail`
    preference the email field will automatically be marked as required.

for patrons registered via the OPAC.

   patrons registered via the OPAC will be put in to.

    **Important**

    Patrons registering via the OPAC will not need to be approved by a
    librarian. For this reason it is recommended that you set up a
    provisional :ref:`patron category <patron-categories-label>` with no :ref:`circulation
    rights <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`. That way patrons will have to come in to
    the library to verify their identity before given circulation rights
    at the library. Once the patron confirms their identiy the library
    staff can change the category to one with permissions to check items
    out and place holds.

    **Important**

    If you leave this blank or enter in an invalid code your patrons
    will still be able to register but will not be given a username.

:ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationDefaultCategory` \_\_\_ days after account creation.

Default: 0

Description:

-  This preference links to the 
   :ref:`cleanup\_database cron job <cron-clean-up-database-label>`. If that 
   cron is set to run nightly with the --del-exp-selfreg parameter, it will clean 
   up any registrations that have not been verified via email in the number of 
   days entered on this preference.

-  This preference is dependent on the :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationVerifyByEmail`
   system preference.

.. _patronselfregistrationlibrarylist-label:

PatronSelfRegistrationLibraryList
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Enable the self registration for the following libraries: \_\_\_

   log in as soon as they fill in the registration form. You can set the
   :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationExpireTemporaryAccountsDelay`
   preference to delete the un-verified self registrations after a
   certain number of days.

    **Note**

    If you're going to require that patrons verify their accounts via
    email then the email field will automatically be marked as required.

    **Important**

    If you require email verification, also set 
    :ref:`PatronSelfRegistrationConfirmEmail` to 'Require' to prevent patrons
    from entering an erroneous email address and never being able to confirm 
    their account.
