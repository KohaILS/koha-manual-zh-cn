-  If set to 'Cumulate', the patron will be restricted for the sum of all the 
   restriction period. (For example, if a patron has a restriction of 10 days

-  If the location value on the left of the colon (:) matches
   the item's current location, it will be updated to match the location value
   on the right of the colon (:).

-  The values are the LOC :ref:`authorised values <existing-values-label>`.

-  For example, 'STAFF: GEN' will move an item from the staff office to the
   general collection when the item is checked in.

-  Special terms

   -  PROC: Processing center. When using PROC, only the current location will
      be affected.

   -  CART: Shelving cart. When using CART, only the current location will be
      affected.

   -  \_PERM\_: This will use the item's permanent location, whatever that
      location is.

      override all other rules.

  **Important**

  -  Make sure there is NO space between the first value and the colon

  -  Make sure there IS a space between the colon and the second value

  -  Make sure each pair is on its own line

  -  Requires YAML syntax 

-  If using PROC or CART, use the 
   :ref:`cart\_to\_shelf cron job <cron-in-processing/book-cart-label>` to

not for loan value on the left matches the items not for loan value it
will be updated to the right-hand value.

Description:

-  This system preference affects the item's 'not for loan' status
   when the item is checked in (whether it was checked out or not).

-  If the status value on the left of the colon (:) matches
   the item's current status, it will be updated to match the status value
   on the right of the colon (:).

-  The values are the NOT\_LOAN :ref:`authorised values <existing-values-label>`.

-  For example, '-1: 0' will cause an item that was set to 'Ordered' to now be 
   available for loan

.. _agerestrictionmarker-label:

AgeRestrictionMarker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Restrict patrons with the following target audience values from
checking out inappropriate materials: \_\_\_

Description:

-  This preference defines certain keywords that will trigger Koha to
   restrict checkout based on age. These restrictions can be overridden
   by the :ref:`AgeRestrictionOverride`
   preference. Enter in this field a series of keywords separated by bar
   (\|) with no spaces. For example PG\|R\|E\|EC\|Age\| will look for PG
   followed by an age number, R folllowed by an age number, Age followed
   by an age number, and so on. These values can appear in any MARC
   field, but Library of Congress recommends the 521$a (Target Audience
   Note). Whatever field you decide to use you must map the word
   agerestriction in the biblioitems table to that field in the :ref:`Koha to
   MARC Mapping <koha-to-marc-mapping-label>`. When cataloging you can enter
   values like PG 13 or E 10 in the 521$a and Koha will then notify
   circulation librarians that the material may not be recommended for
   the patron based on their age.

       **Important**

       You must map the word agerestriction in the biblioitems table to
       the MARC field where this information will appear via the :ref:`Koha
       to MARC Mapping <koha-to-marc-mapping-label>` administration area.

.. _agerestrictionoverride-label:

   |image25|

-  Don't allow

   |image26|

Description:

-  When the :ref:`AgeRestrictionMarker` preference
   is set, Koha will try to warn circulation librarians before checking

   record. This preference asks if you would like the staff to be able
   to still check out these items to patrons under the age limit.

.. _allfinesneedoverride-label:

AllFinesNeedOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Require

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override all fines, even fines less than
:ref:`noissuescharge`.

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

Description:

-  This preference let's you decide if you want to always be warned that
   the patron has fines when checking out. If you have it set to
   'Require' then no matter how much money the patron owes a message
   will pop up warning you that the patron owes money.

.. _allowfineoverride-label:

AllowFineOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override and check out items to patrons
who have more than :ref:`noissuescharge` in fines.

Values:

-  Allow

Description:

-  This preference lets you decide if you staff can check out to patrons
   who owe more money than you usually let them carry on their account.

   but it won't stop the staff from checking out to the patron.

.. _allowitemsonholdcheckoutsco-label:

AllowItemsOnHoldCheckoutSCO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ checkouts of items reserved to someone else in the SCO module.
If allowed do not generate RESERVE_WAITING and RESERVED warning. This
allows self checkouts for those items.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

    **Important**

    This system preference relates only to Koha's web based self checkout.

Description:

-  When this preference is set to 'Allow' patrons will be able to use
   Koha's web based self checkout to check out a book to themselves
   even if it's on hold for someone else. If you would like Koha to
   prevent people from checking out books that are on hold for someone
   else set this preference to "Don't allow".

.. _allowitemsonholdcheckout-label:

AllowItemsOnHoldCheckoutSIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ checkouts of items reserved to someone else via SIP checkout 
messages.

Default: Don't allow

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

    **Important**

    This system preference relates only to SIP-based self-checkout, not
    Koha's web based self checkout.

Description:

-  When this preference is set to 'Allow' patrons will be able to use
   your external self check machine to check out a book to themselves
   even if it's on hold for someone else.

-  If you would like Koha to prevent people from checking out books that are 
   on hold for someone else set this preference to 'Don't allow'.

.. _allowmultipleissuesonabiblio-label:

AllowMultipleIssuesOnABiblio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons to check out multiple items from the same record.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If this preference is set to 'Allow' then patrons will be able to
   check out multiple copies of the same title at the same time. If it's
   set to "Don't allow" then patrons will only be allowed to check out
   one item attached to a record at a time. Regardless of the option
   chosen in this preference records with subscriptions attached will
   allow multiple check outs.

       **Important**

       This will only effect records without a subscription attached.

.. _allownotforloanoverride-label:

AllowNotForLoanOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override and check out items that are marked as
not for loan.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This parameter is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff (patrons will always be prevented from checking these items
   out) to check out items that are marked as "not for loan". Setting it
   to "Allow" would allow such items to be checked out, setting it to
   "Don't allow" would prevent this. This setting determines whether
   items meant to stay in the library, such as reference materials, and
   other library resources can be checked out by patrons.

.. _allowrenewallimitoverride-label:

AllowRenewalLimitOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to manually override the renewal limit and renew a
checkout when it would go over the renewal limit.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which controls the ability of
   staff to override the limits placed on the number of times an item
   can be renewed. Setting it to "Allow" would allow such limits to be
   overridden, setting it to "Don't allow" would prevent this. This is a
   preference in which if it is set to "allow" it would allow the
   library staff to use their judgment for overriding the renew limit
   for special cases, setting it to "Don't allow" prevents an
   opportunity for abuse by the library staff.

.. _allowrenewalonholdoverride-label:

AllowRenewalOnHoldOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to renew items that are on hold by manually specifying a due date.

Default: Don't allow

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

- This preference enables items that are on hold to be renewed with a due date specified by the user.

  It can appear in two locations:

  1. In the "Checkouts" table on the Patron Details screen. It is possible to select on loan items that would otherwise fulfil a hold request to be renewed. When such an item is selected, an additional date selection box is displayed to allow the user to specify the due date for all on hold items that are to be renewed.

  2. In the Circulation > Renew alert screen. When a barcode of an on loan item that would ordinarily fulfil a hold request is entered, the usual alert is displayed indicating that the item is on hold, it is still possible to override this, and renew. With this preference enabled it is also possible to specify a due date.

.. _allowreturntobranch-label:

AllowReturnToBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: to any library

Asks: Allow materials to be returned to \_\_\_

Values:

-  either the library the item is from or the library it was checked out
   from.

-  only the library the item is from.

-  only the library the item was checked out from.

-  to any library.

Description:

-  This preference lets the library system decide how they will accept
   returns. Some systems allow for items to be returned to any library
   in the system (the default value of this preference) others want to
   limit item returns to only specific branches. This preference will
   allow you to limit item returns (checkins) to the branch(es) set in
   the value.

.. _allowtoomanyoverride-label:

AllowTooManyOverride
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to override and check out items when the patron has
reached the maximum number of allowed checkouts.

Values:

-  Allow

   |image27|

-  Don't allow

   |image28|

Description:

-  If this preference is set to "Allow" then staff all will be presented
   with an option to checkout more items to a patron than are normally
   allowed in the :ref:`Circulation and fines rules`. If
   this preference is set to "Don't allow" then no staff member will be
   able to check out more than the circulation limit.

.. _automaticitemreturn-label:

AutomaticItemReturn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do

Asks: \_\_\_ automatically transfer items to their home branch when they
are returned.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether an item
   is returned to its home branch automatically or not. If set to
   "Don't", the staff member checking an item in at a location other
   than the item's home branch will be asked whether the item will
   remain at the non-home branch (in which case the new location will be
   marked as a holding location) or returned. Setting it to "Do" will
   ensure that items checked in at a branch other than their home branch
   will be sent to that home branch.

.. _autoremoveoverduesrestrictions-label:

AutoRemoveOverduesRestrictions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not

Asks: \_\_\_ allow OVERDUES restrictions triggered by sent notices to be
cleared automatically when all overdue items are returned by a patron.

   not.

.. _autoreturncheckedoutitems-label:

AutoReturnCheckedOutItems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

is already checked out to another patron.

Values:

-  Do

-  Don't

Default: Do

Description:

-  This preference controls whether Koha asks for a confirmation when trying
   to check out an item that is already checked out to another patron.

-  Set to 'Do', Koha will ask the staff member to confirm the check out.

   |image1433|

-  Set to 'Don't', Koha will simply return the item from the previous
   patron's file and check it out to the actual patron and show a message.

   |image1434|

.. _circcontrol-label:

CircControl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: the library the item is from

Asks: Use the checkout and fines rules of \_\_\_

Values:

-  the library the item is from

   -  The :ref:`circulation and fines policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`
      will be determined by the item's library where :ref:`HomeOrHoldingBranch`
      chooses if item's home library is used or holding library is used.

-  the library the patron is from

   -  The :ref:`circulation and fines policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>`
      will be determined the patron's home library

-  the library you are logged in at

      determined by the library that checked the item out to the patron

.. _consideronsitecheckoutsasnormalcheckouts-label:

ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ on-site checkouts as normal checkouts. If enabled, on-site 
checkouts will count toward the checkout limit for regular checkouts. The 
on-site limit will still apply for on-site checkouts. If disabled, both values 
will be checked separately.

Default: Consider

Values:

-  Consider

-  Don't consider

Description:

-  This preference allows you to decide if checkouts that are considered 
   :ref:`on-site checkouts <onsitecheckouts-label>` are counted toward the total
   checkouts a patron can have. You can also set your 
   :ref:`circulation and fines rules <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` to 
   allow only a certain number of normal and on-site checkouts.

.. _defaultlongoverduechargevalue-label:

DefaultLongOverdueChargeValue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Charge a lost item to the borrower's account when the LOST value
of the item changes to \_\_\_

Description:

-  Leave this field empty if you don't want to charge the user for lost
   items. If you want the user to be charged enter the `LOST authorized
   value <#lost>`__ you are using in the
   :ref:`DefaultLongOverdueLostValue <defaultlongoverduelostvalue-and-defaultlongoverduedays-label>`
   preference. This preference is used when the :ref:`longoverdue cron
   job <cron-long-overdues-label>` is called without the --charge parameter.

.. _defaultlongoverduelostvalue-and-defaultlongoverduedays-label:

DefaultLongOverdueLostValue and DefaultLongOverdueDays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: By default, set the LOST value of an item to \_\_\_ when the item
has been overdue for more than \_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  These preferences are used when the :ref:`longoverdue cron
   job <cron-long-overdues-label>` is called without the --lost parameter. It
   allows users to set the values of the :ref:`longoverdue
   cron <cron-long-overdues-label>` without having to edit the crontab.
   Setting the values to 1 and 30 for example will mark the item with
   the `LOST authorized value <#lost>`__ of 1 after the item is 30 days
   overdue.

.. _holdsinnoissuescharge-label:

HoldsInNoissuesCharge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Use the checkout and fines rules of \_\_\_

Values:

-  the item's home library (homebranch).

-  the item's holding library (holdingbranch).

Description:

-  This preference does several things.

   -  If :ref:`CircControl` is set to 'the library the item
      is from' then the :ref:`circulation and fines
      policies <circulation-and-fines-rules-label>` will be determined by the item's
      library where HomeOrHoldingBranch chooses if item's home library
      is used or holding library is used.

   -  If :ref:`IndependentBranches` is set to
      'Prevent' then the value of this preference is used in figuring
      out if the item can be checked out. If the item's home library
      does not match the logged in library, the item cannot be checked
      out unless you are a :ref:`superlibrarian <patron-permissions-defined-label>`.

    **Important**

    It is not recommend that this setting be changed after initial setup
    of Koha because it will change the behavior of items already checked
    out.

.. _issuelostitem-label:

   |image29|

-  do nothing

   -  This option will just check the item out without notifying you
      that the item was marked lost.

-  require confirmation

   |image30|

Description:

-  This preference lets you define how library staff are notified that
   an item with a lost status is being checked out. This will help staff
   mark items as 'available' if you choose to 'display a message' or

Description:

-  This preference determines if a patron can check items out if there
   is an overdue fine on the account and any of the materials the patron
   wishes to check out will potentially tip the account balance over the
   maximum fines policy the library has in place.

Example: Your library has a $5 limit set for 'fines' (ie, after
incurring $5 in fines, a patron can no longer check out items). A patron
comes to the desk with 5 items to check out (4 books and a video) The
patron has $4 in charges already on their account. One of the videos has
a rental charge of $1, therefore making the total fines on the patron's
account suddenly $5 (the limit).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Define custom rules to deny specific items from renewal.

Description:

-  This preference allows you to specify items that should not be renewed
   either from the OPAC or staff client.  You can enter any combination of

   then a space then a bracketed list of values separated by commas. e.g:

   ::

       ccode: [NEWFIC,NULL,DVD]
       itype: [NEWBK,""]

-  The word 'NULL' can be used to block renewal on undefined fields,
   while an empty string "" will block on an empty (but defined) field.

    **Note**

    If using automatic renewal notices your notice text should be updated to
    account for the new reason that renewals may be denied "item_denied_renewal".

   are included when calculating the
   :ref:`noissuescharge`. If this is set to 'Include' then
   Koha will include all manual invoices when deciding if the patron
   owes too much money to check anything else out of the library. If
   it's set to 'Don't include' then Koha will ignore all manual invoice
   charges when figuring out if the patron owes too much money to
   checkout additional materials.

   :ref:`ManInvInNoissuesCharge` and
   :ref:`RentalsInNoissuesCharge` preferences
   you can control which types of charges are considered in this total.
   This also coincides with :ref:`maxoutstanding` that
   limits patrons from placing holds when the maximum amount is owed to
   the library.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ when calculating the date due.

Default: Use the calendar to skip days the library is closed

Values:

-  Use the calendar to skip days the library is closed

-  Use the calendar to push the due date to the next open day

-  Ignore the calendar

-  Use the calendar to push the due date to the next open matching weekday
   for weekly loan periods, or the next open day otherwise (Note: This preference
   setting only works with loan periods in multiples of 7).

Description:

-  This preference controls how scheduled library closures affect the
   due date of a material.

-  The 'Use the calendar to skip all days the library is closed' setting allows 
   for a scheduled closure not to count as a day in the loan period. 

-  The 'Ignore the calendar' setting would not consider the scheduled closure 
   at all

-  The 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the next open day' would only 
   affect the due date if the day the item is due would fall specifically on
   the day of closure.

-  The final option, 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the next open 
   matching weekday for weekly loan periods, or the next open day otherwise' 
   allows libraries to accommodate patrons who may only be able to visit the 
   library on a certain day of the week, such as part-time students or patrons 
   who rely on public transport.

Example:

-  The library has put December 24th and 25th in as closures on the
   calendar. A book checked out by a patron has a due date of December
   25th according to the circulation and fine rules.

   -  If this preference is set to 'Ignore the calendar' then the item will 
      remain due on the 25th.

   -  If the preference is set to 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the 
      next open day', then the due date will be December 26th.

   -  If the preference is set to 'Usethe calendar to skip all days the library 
      is closed' then the due date will be pushed to the 27th of December to 
      accommodate for the two closed days.

   -  If the preference is set to 'Use the calendar to push the due date to the 
      next open matching weekday for weekly loan periods, or the next open day 
      otherwise' the item would be due back on January 1st. If January 1st was 
      also a closed day then the item would be due back on the next available 
      open day.

The calendar is defined on a branch by branch basis. To learn more about
the calendar, check out the :ref:`Calendar<calendar-label>`
section of this manual.

.. _usetransportcostmatrix-label:

UseTransportCostMatrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't use

Asks: \_\_\_ Transport Cost Matrix for calculating optimal holds filling
between branches.

Values:

-  Don't use

-  Use

Description:

-  If the system is configured to use the :ref:`Transport cost
   matrix <transport-cost-matrix-label>` for filling holds, then when
   attempting to fill a hold, the system will search for the lowest cost
   branch, and attempt to fill the hold with an item from that branch
   first. Branches of equal cost will be selected from randomly. The
   branch or branches of the next highest cost shall be selected from
   only if all the branches in the previous group are unable to fill the
   hold.

   The system will use the item's current holding branch when
   determining whether the item can fulfill a hold using the Transport
   Cost Matrix.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ when calculating the period for fines.

Default: Use the calendar

Values:

Description:

-  This preference will determine whether or not fines will be accrued
   on days where the library is closed. Examples include holidays, library 
   in-service days, etc. 

-  If set to 'Use the calendar', Koha will skip closed days when calculating 
   the overdue fines.

-  If set to 'Ignore the calendar', fines will be calculated directly, with 
   no consideration of closed days.

  **Important**

  To make use of this setting your system administrator must first access 
  Koha's :ref:calendar<calendar-label>` and mark closed days as 'holidays'
  ahead of time.

The calendar is defined on a branch by branch basis. To learn more about
the calendar, check out the :ref:`calendar <calendar-label>`

    If the cronjobs/fines.pl cronjob is being run, accruing and final fines will 
    be calculated when the cron runs and accruing fines will be finalized when 
    an item is returned. If CalculateFinesOnReturn is enabled, final fines will 
    be calculated when an item is returned.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

   library staff can override the circulation and fines rules as they
   pertain to the placement of holds. Setting this value to "Don't
   allow" will prevent anyone from overriding, setting it to "Allow"
   will allow it. This setting is important because it determines how
   strict the libraries rules for placing holds are. If this is set to
   "Allow", exceptions can be made for patrons who are otherwise
   normally in good standing with the library, but there is opportunity
   for the staff to abuse this function. If it is set to "Don't allow",
   no abuse of the system is possible, but it makes the system entirely
   inflexible in respect to holds.

   Setting this value to "Don't allow" will prevent anyone from placing
   a hold on such items, setting it to "Allow" will allow it. This
   preference is important because it determines whether or not a patron
   can place a request for an item that might be in the process of being
   repaired or not in good condition. The library may wish to set this
   to "Don't allow" if they were concerned about their patrons not
   receiving the item in a timely manner or at all (if it is determined
   that the item is beyond repair). Setting it to "Allow" would allow a
   patron to place a hold on an item and therefore receive it as soon as
   it becomes available.

.. _allowholdsonpatronspossessions-label:

AllowHoldsOnPatronsPossessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_\_ a patron to place a hold on a record where the patron
already has one or more items attached to that record checked out.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  By setting to "Don't allow," you can prevent patrons from placing
   holds on items they already have out, thus preventing them from
   blocking anyone else from getting an item.

.. _allowrenewalifotheritemsavailable-label:

AllowRenewalIfOtherItemsAvailable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a patron to renew an item with unfilled holds if other
available items can fill that hold.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _autoresumesuspendedholds-label:

AutoResumeSuspendedHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ suspended holds to be automatically resumed by a set date.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If this preference is set to 'Allow' then all suspended holds will be
   able to have a date at after which they automatically become
   unsuspended. If you have this preference set to 'Allow' you will also
   need the :ref:`Unsuspend Holds` cron job running.

    **Important**

    The holds will become unsuspended the date after that entered by the
    patron.

.. _canmarkholdstopullaslost-label:

CanMarkHoldsToPullAsLost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ from the 'Holds to pull' screen

Default: Do not allow to mark items as lost

Values:

-  Allow to mark items as lost

-  Allow to mark items as lost and notify the patron

-  Do not allow to mark items as lot

Description:

-  This preference lets you choose whether the staff can mark items
   as lost directly from the 'Holds to pull' list if they can't
   find the item on the shelf.

-  The actual lost value that will be assigned to the item is defined in the 
   :ref:`UpdateItemWhenLostFromHoldList` system preference.

.. _canreservefromotherbranches-label:

canreservefromotherbranches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a user from one library to place a hold on an item from
another library

Description:

-  This preference is a binary setting which determines whether patrons
   can place holds on items from other branches. If the preference is
   set to "Allow" patrons can place such holds, if it is set to "Don't
   allow" they cannot. This is an important setting because it
   determines if users can use Koha to request items from another
   branch. If the library is sharing an installation of Koha with other
   independent libraries which do not wish to allow interlibrary
   borrowing it is recommended that this parameter be set to "Don't
   allow".

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow (with :ref:`IndependentBranches`)

.. _confirmfutureholds-label:

ConfirmFutureHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 0

Asks: Confirm future hold requests (starting no later than \_\_\_ days
from now) at checkin time.

Description:

-  When confirming a hold at checkin time, the number of days in this
   preference is taken into account when deciding which holds to show
   alerts for. This preference does not interfere with renewing,
   checking out or transferring a book.

    **Note**

    This number of days will be used too in calculating the default end
    date for the Holds to pull-report. But it does not interfere with
    issuing, renewing or transferring books.

    **Important**

    This preference is only looked at if you're allowing hold dates in
    the future with :ref:`AllowHoldDateInFuture`
    or :ref:`OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture`

.. _decreaseloanhighholds-preferences-label:

decreaseLoanHighHolds, decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration, decreaseLoanHighHoldsValue, decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl, and decreaseLoanHighHoldsIgnoreStatuses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ the reduction of loan period \_\_\_ to days for items with
more than \_\_\_ holds \_\_\_ . Ignore items with the following statuses
when counting items \_\_\_

decreaseLoanHighHolds default: Don't enable

decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl default: on the record

decreaseLoanHighHolds values:

-  Enable

decreaseLoanHighHoldsControl values:

-  over the number of holdable items on the records

-  on the record

decreaseLoanHighHoldsIgnoreStatuses values:

-  [Select All]

-  Damages

-  Lost

-  Not for loan

-  Withdrawn

Description:

-  These preferences let you change the loan length for items that have
   many holds on them. This will not effect items that are already
   checked out, but items that are checked out after the
   decreaseLoanHighHoldsValue is met will only be checked out for the
   number of days entered in the decreaseLoanHighHoldsDuration
   preference.

.. _emaillibrarianwhenholdisplaced-label:

emailLibrarianWhenHoldIsPlaced
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ sending an email to the Koha administrator email address
whenever a hold request is placed.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  This preference enables Koha to email the library staff whenever a
   patron requests an item to be held. While this function will
   immediately alert the librarian to the patron's need, it is extremely
   impractical in most library settings. In most libraries the hold
   lists are monitored and maintained from a separate interface. That
   said, many libraries that allow on shelf holds prefer to have this
   preference turned on so that they are alerted to pull an item from
   the shelf.

    **Important**

    In order for this email to send you must have a
    :ref:`notice <notices-and-slips-label>` template with the code of HOLDPLACED

    **Important**

    This notice will only be sent if the :ref:`process\_message\_queue.pl
    cron job <cron-message-queue-label>` is being run periodically to send the
    messages.

.. _excludeholidaysfrommaxpickupdelay-label:

ExcludeHolidaysFromMaxPickUpDelay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ when calculating the period for reserves max pickup delay.

Default: Ignore the calendar

Values:

-  Ignore the calendar

-  Use the calendar

Description:

-  This system preference determines whether or not closed days in the 
   :ref:`calendar<calendar-label>` are taken into account when calculating the 
   time period for patrons to pick up their holds (see 
   :ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay`).

-  If set to 'Ignore the calendar', the pickup delay will be calculated 
   directly.

-  If set to 'Use the calendar', holidays will be excluded from the pickup 
   delay.

.. _expirereservesmaxpickupdelay-label:

ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to expire automatically if they have not been picked
by within the time period specified in
:ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay`

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  If set to 'allow' this will cancel holds that have been waiting for
   longer than the number of days specified in the
   :ref:`ReservesMaxPickUpDelay` system
   preference. Holds will only be cancelled if the :ref:`Expire Holds cron
   job <cron-expired-holds-label>` is runnning.

.. _expirereservesmaxpickupdelaycharge-label:

ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelayCharge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 0

Asks: If using
:ref:`ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay`, charge
a borrower who allows his or her waiting hold to expire a fee of \_\_\_
USD

Description:

-  If you are expiring holds that have been waiting too long you can use
   this preference to charge the patron for not picking up their hold.
   If you don't charge patrons for items that aren't picked up you can
   leave this set to the default which is 0. Holds will only be
   cancelled and charged if the :ref:`Expire Holds cron
   job <cron-expired-holds-label>` is running.

.. _expirereservesonholidays-label:

ExpireReservesOnHolidays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ expired holds to be cancelled on days the library is
closed.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

.. _holdssplitqueue-label:

HoldsSplitQueue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: nothing

Asks: In the staff client, split the holds queue into separate tables by \_\_\_

Values:

-  pickup library

-  pickup library and itemtype

-  hold itemtype

-  nothing

Description:

-  This feature allows you to separate holds by pickup library or itemtype in the
   holds page of a record (not in the global holds queue found on the circulation
   page).

-  When using the up and down arrows the priorities will be changed only
   in the group the holds belongs to.

.. _holdssplitqueuenumbering-label:

HoldsSplitQueueNumbering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: the actual priority, which may be out of order

Asks: If the holds queue is split, show librarians \_\_\_

Values:

-  the actual priority, which may be out of order

-  'virtual' priorities, where each group is numbered separately

Description:

-  This system preference is only effective if :ref:`HoldsSplitQueue` is set to
   any value except 'nothing'.

-  This system preference controls the priority numbering on the holds page
   of a record (not in the global holds queue found on the circulation page).

.. _localholdspriority-preferences-label:

LocalHoldsPriority, LocalHoldsPriorityPatronControl, LocalHoldsPriorityItemControl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: \_\_\_ priority for filling holds to patrons whose \_\_\_ matches
the item's \_\_\_

   returned, a local hold may be given priority for fulfillment even
   though it is of lower priority in the list of unfilled holds.

.. _maxreserves-label:

maxreserves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 50

Asks: Patrons can only have \_\_\_ holds at once.

.. _opacallowholddateinfuture-label:

OPACAllowHoldDateInFuture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons to place holds that don't enter the waiting list
until a certain future date.

Values:

-  Allow

   -  :ref:`AllowHoldDateInFuture` must also be
      enabled for this to work

-  Don't allow

.. _opacallowusertochoosebranch-label:

OPACAllowUserToChooseBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ a user to choose the library to pick up a hold from.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  Changing this preference will not prevent staff from being able to
   transfer titles from one library to another to fill a hold, it will
   only prevent patrons from saying they plan on picking a book up at a
   library other than their home library.

-  The list of available pickup locations will include all libraries that
   have 'Pickup location' set to 'Yes' on the library configuration page.

.. _opacholdsifavailableatpickup-label:

OPACHoldsIfAvailableAtPickup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ to pickup holds at libraries where the item is available.

Values:

-  Don't allow

-  Allow

Description:

Default: blank

Asks: Patron categories not affected by :ref:`OPACHoldsIfAvailableAtPickup`
\_\_\_ (list of patron categories separated with a pipe ^|^)

Description:

-  Patron category codes listed here separated by a pipe ^|^ are unaffected by
   :ref:`OPACHoldsIfAvailableAtPickup`.

.. _reservescontrolbranch-label:

ReservesControlBranch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: item's home library

Asks: Check the \_\_\_ to see if the patron can place a hold on the
item.

Values:

-  item's home library.

-  patron's home library.

.. _reservesmaxpickupdelay-label:

ReservesMaxPickUpDelay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 7

Asks: Mark a hold as problematic if it has been waiting for more than
\_\_\_ days.

Description:

-  This preference (based on calendar days, not the
   :ref:`Koha holiday calendar <calendar-label>`) puts an expiration date on an item a
   patron has on hold. After this expiration date the staff will have
   the option to release the unclaimed hold which then may be returned
   to the library shelf or issued to the next patron on the item's hold
   list. Items that are 'expired' by this preference are moved to the
   'Holds Over' tab on the :ref:`Holds Awaiting Pickup <holds-awaiting-pickup-label>`
   report.

.. _reservesneedreturns-label:

ReservesNeedReturns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't automatically

Asks: \_\_\_ mark holds as found and waiting when a hold is placed
specifically on them and they are already checked in.

Values:

-  Automatically

-  Don't automatically

Description:

-  This preference refers to 'item specific' holds where the item is
   currently on the library shelf. This preference allows a library to
   decide whether an 'item specific' hold is marked as "Waiting" at the
   time the hold is placed or if the item will be marked as "Waiting"
   after the item is checked in. This preference will tell the patron
   that their item is 'Waiting' for them at their library and ready for
   check out.

.. _holds-queue-system-preferences-label:

StaticHoldsQueueWeight, HoldsQueueSkipClosed and RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

StaticHoldsQueueWeight Default: 0

HoldsQueueSkipClosed Default: open or closed

RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight Default: in that order

Asks: Satisfy holds using items from the libraries \_\_\_ (as
branchcodes, separated by commas; if empty, uses all libraries) when
they are \_\_\_ \_\_\_.

HoldsQueueSkipClosed Values:

-  open or closed

-  open

RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight Values:

-  in random order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default Koha will
      randomize all libraries, otherwise it will randomize the libraries
      listed.

-  in that order

   -  If StaticHoldsQueueWeight is left at the default then this will
      use all of your branches in alphabetical order, otherwise it will
      use the branches in the order that you entered them in the
      StaticHoldsQueueWeight preference.

Descriptions:

-  These preferences control how the :ref:`Holds Queue
   report <holds-queue-label>` is generated using :ref:`a cron
   job <cron-holds-queue-report-label>`.

   If you do not want all of your libraries to participate in the
   on-shelf holds fulfillment process, you should list the the libraries
   that \*do\* participate in the process here by inputting all the
   participating library's branchcodes, separated by commas ( e.g.
   "MPL,CPL,SPL,BML" etc. ).

   By default, the holds queue will be generated such that the system
   will first attempt to hold fulfillment using items already at the
   pickup library if possible. If there are no items available at the
   pickup library to fill a hold, build\_holds\_queue.pl will then use
   the list of libraries defined in StaticHoldsQueueWeight. If
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight is disabled ( which it is by default ), the
   script will assign fulfillment requests in the order the branches are
   placed in the StaticHoldsQueueWeight system preference.

   For example, if your system has three libraries, of varying sizes (
   small, medium and large ) and you want the burden of holds
   fulfillment to be on larger libraries before smaller libraries, you
   would want StaticHoldsQueueWeight to look something like
   "LRG,MED,SML".

   If you want the burden of holds fulfillment to be spread out equally
   throughout your library system, simply enable
   RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight. When this system preference is enabled,
   the order in which libraries will be requested to fulfill an on-shelf
   hold will be randomized each time the list is regenerated.

    **Important**

    The :ref:`Transport Cost Matrix <transport-cost-matrix-label>` takes
    precedence in controlling where holds are filled from, if the matrix
    is not used then Koha checks the StaticHoldsQueueWeight. To use the
    Transport Cost Matrix simply set your
    :ref:`UseTransportCostMatrix` preference to
    'Use'

.. _suspendholdsintranet-label:

SuspendHoldsIntranet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to be suspended from the intranet.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  The holds suspension feature can be turned on and off in the staff
   client by altering this system preference. If this is set to 'allow'
   you will want to set the
   :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds` system
   preference.

.. _suspendholdsopac-label:

SuspendHoldsOpac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Allow

Asks: \_\_\_ holds to be suspended from the OPAC.

Values:

-  Allow

-  Don't allow

Description:

-  The holds suspension feature can be turned on and off in the OPAC by
   altering this system preference. If this is set to 'allow' you will
   want to set the
   :ref:`AutoResumeSuspendedHolds` system
   preference.

.. _transferwhencancelallwaitingholds-label:

TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't transfer

Asks: \_\_\_ items when cancelling all waiting holds.

Values:

-  Don't transfer

-  Transfer

Description:

-  When TransferWhenCancelAllWaitingHolds is set to "Don't transfer", no
   branch transfer records are created. Koha will not allow the holds to
   be transferred, because that would orphan the items at the library
   where the holds were awaiting pickup, without any further instruction
   to staff as to what items are at the library or where they need to
   go. When that system preference set to "Transfer", branch transfers
   are created, so the holds may be cancelled.

.. _updateitemwhenlostfromholdlist-label:

UpdateItemWhenLostFromHoldList
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asks: Update item's values when marked as lost from the hold to pull screen.

Description:

-  This is a list of values to update an item when it is marked as lost from
   the holds to pull screen. For example, write "itemlost: 1" to set the items.
   itemlost value to 1 when the item is marked as lost. This will use the authorized
   value 1 from the :ref:`LOST authorized value list<existing-values-label>`.

-  Examples of keywords:

   -  itemlost: lost status, uses the 
      :ref:`LOST authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  notforloan: not for loan status, uses the 
      :ref:`NOT_LOAN authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  withdrawn: withdrawn status, uses the 
      :ref:`WITHDRAWN authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  damaged: damaged status, uses the 
      :ref:`DAMAGED authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  location: location code, uses the 
      :ref:`LOC authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

   -  ccode: collection code, uses the 
      :ref:`CCODE authorized values list<existing-values-label>`

-  This preference requires that the :ref:`CanMarkHoldsToPullAsLost` system
   preference be set to either 'Allow' option


**Important**

-  Requires YAML syntax to work

Default: Don't allow

Asks: \_\_\_ patrons to submit notes about checked out items.

Values:

-  Don't allow

-  Allow

This preference if set to allow will give your patrons the option to add
a note to an item they have checked out on the OPAC side.  This note will be
seen on the staff side when the item is checked in.

.. _allowofflinecirculation-label:

AllowOfflineCirculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Do not enable

Asks: \_\_\_ offline circulation on regular circulation computers.

Values:

-  Do not enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  Setting this preference to 'Enable' allows you to use the Koha
   interface for :ref:`offline circulation <offline-circulation-utilities-label>`. This system
   preference does not affect the :ref:`Firefox
   plugin <firefox-plugin-label>` or the :ref:`desktop
   application <offline-circ-tool-for-windows-label>`, any of these three options can
   be used for offline circulation without effecting the other.

.. _autoswitchpatron-label:

AutoSwitchPatron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ the automatic redirection to another patron when a patron
barcode is scanned instead of a book. This should not be enabled if you
have overlapping patron and book barcodes.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

Description:

-  Enabling this system preference allows staff to scan a patron barcode instead
   of an item barcode in the checkout box to switch patron records.

.. _circautoprintquickslip-label:

CircAutoPrintQuickSlip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: open a print quick slip window

Asks: When an empty barcode field is submitted in circulation \_\_\_

Values:

-  clear the screen

-  open a print quick slip window

-  open a print slip window

Description:

-  If this preference is set to open a quick slip
   (:ref:`ISSUEQSLIP <existing-notices-and-slips-label>`) or open a slip
   (:ref:`ISSUESLIP <existing-notices-and-slips-label>`) for printing it will eliminate the
   need for the librarian to click the print button to generate a
   checkout receipt for the patron they're checking out to. If the
   preference is set to clear the screen then "checking out" an empty
   barcode will clear the screen of the patron you were last working
   with.

.. _circsidebar-label:

CircSidebar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Deactivate

Asks: \_\_\_ the navigation sidebar on all Circulation pages.

Values:

-  Deactivate

   automatically be excluded when exporting the patron's current
   checkout history.

   |image38|

.. _filterbeforeoverduereport-label:

FilterBeforeOverdueReport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't require

Asks: \_\_\_ staff to choose which checkouts to show before running the
overdues report.

Description:

-  Koha's overdue report shows you all of the overdue items in your
   library system. If you have a large library system you'll want to set
   this preference to 'Require' to force those running the report to
   first limit the data generated to a branch, date range, patron
   category or other such filter. Requiring that the report be filtered
   before it's run prevents your staff from running a system heavy
   report and slowing down other operations in the system.

   |image34|

Values:

-  Don't require

-  Require

.. _finenotifyatcheckin-label:

FineNotifyAtCheckin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't notify

Asks: \_\_\_ librarians of overdue fines on the items they are checking
in.

Values:

-  Don't notify

-  Notify

Description:

-  With this preference set to 'Notify' all books that have overdue
   fines owed on them will pop up a warning when checking them in. This
   warning will need to acknowledged before you can continue checking
   items in. With this preference set to 'Don't notify,^ you will still
   see fines owed on the patron record, you just won't have an
   additional notification at check in.

   |image35|

.. _holdstopullstartdate-label:

HoldsToPullStartDate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: 2

Asks: Set the default start date for the Holds to pull list to \_\_\_
day(s) ago.

Description:

-  The :ref:`Holds to Pull <holds-to-pull-label>` report in circulation defaults to
   filtering holds placed 2 days ago. This preference allows you to set
   this default filter to any number of days.

.. _itembarcodefallbacksearch-label:

itemBarcodeFallbackSearch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default: Don't enable

Asks: \_\_\_ the automatic use of a keyword catalog search if the phrase
entered as a barcode on the checkout page does not turn up any results
during an item barcode search.

Values:

-  Don't enable

-  Enable

   |image40|

Description:

-  Sometimes libraries want to checkout using something other than the
   barcode. Enabling this preference will do a keyword search of Koha to
   find the item you're trying to check out. You can use the call
   number, barcode, part of the title or anything you'd enter in the
   keyword search when this preference is enabled and Koha will ask you
   which item you're trying to check out.

    **Important**

    While you're not searching by barcode a barcode is required on every
    title you check out. Only titles with barcodes will appear in the
    search results.

.. _itembarcodeinputfilter-label:

itemBarcodeInputFilter
